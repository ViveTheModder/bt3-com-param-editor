# Usage/Showcase
This tool has the most amount of tooltips I have ever put in a program.

To put it simply, this option is for [Sparking Studio](https://mega.nz/file/OYM3TQrQ#Sq8_IoOpFI30vF4dDr0R0-JmpQbaseY0fQgsBGjiWxk) users.

If the threshold is left empty, then the tool will choose the default threshold based on the transformation type:
* No Transformation - 0%
* No Bonus - 40%
* Detransformation - 60%
* Health Bonus - 40%
* 25% MAX Health Bonus - 30%
* Full Ki Refill - 30%

This last option will only work if the ``Costume Files`` option is selected.

For better performance, I recommend using the ``Costume Folders`` option, but the ``Costume Files`` option will still do the job right.
